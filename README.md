# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Its key features include:

Readability: Clear and easy-to-understand syntax.
Versatility: Supports various programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
Extensive Libraries: Rich standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages.
Interpreted: No need for compilation, making development and debugging faster.
Community Support: Large, active community and extensive documentation.
Examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: With libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automating repetitive tasks and writing scripts for system administration.
Game Development: Using libraries like Pygame.
Networking: For writing network-related scripts and applications.
2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Windows:

Download the Python installer from python.org.
Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH".
Follow the installation prompts.
Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing python --version.
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
Simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:

print is a built-in function that outputs text to the console.
"Hello, World!" is a string, a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Basic data types in Python:

int: Integer numbers (e.g., 42)
float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14)
str: Strings (e.g., "Hello")
bool: Boolean values (e.g., True, False)
list: Ordered collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
tuple: Immutable ordered collection of items (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
dict: Key-value pairs (e.g., {"key": "value"})
# Integer
a = 10

# Float
b = 3.14

# String
c = "Hello, World!"

# Boolean
d = True

# List
e = [1, 2, 3]

# Tuple
f = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionary
g = {"key": "value"}

print(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Conditional statements and loops:

If-else statement:

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
For loop:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code, reducing redundancy, and improving readability.

Function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Differences between lists and dictionaries:

Lists: Ordered collections of items, accessed by index.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, accessed by keys.
Script demonstrating lists and dictionaries:

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program. You can handle exceptions using try, except, and finally blocks.

Example:

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("This block always executes")
9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
Concepts of modules and packages:

Modules: Single files containing Python code, which can be imported.
Packages: Collections of modules organized in directories.
Importing and using a module:

import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
Reading from and writing to files:

Reading from a file:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

lines = ["Hello, World!", "Python is great."]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
